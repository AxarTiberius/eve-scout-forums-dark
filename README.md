I made some fixes to the dark theme of the [EvE-Scout Forums](https://forums.eve-scout.com/) (that you get when you click the light bulb on the top bar).

I found that there are some awkward contrast issues with the default style, making some things illegible or just aesthetically bad. This theme has custom background images, a dynamic font, and improved readability throughout.

It is installed with the [Stylish](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylish-custom-themes-for/fjnbnpbmkenffdnngjfgmeleoegfcffe) Chrome/Firefox addon.
